        <h3>One of the most powerful smartphones of this generation</h3>
        <p>The main star of the Apple Wonderlust presentation, of course, was the top-end iPhone 15 Pro Max (note: still not Ultra), which boasted an improved camera, a new A17 Bionic processor comparable in power to the Apple M2 laptop chip, and a titanium side frame. Apple says the frame is made from Grade 5 titanium alloy, widely used in industry for its strength and anti-corrosion properties. Thanks to this, the smartphone looks as if its display extends beyond the frames. Also, the overall weight of the smartphone decreased by 10%.</p>
        <h3>Apple A17 processor with hardware ray tracing and upscaler</h3>
        <p>The heart of the iPhone 15 Pro Max is the powerful Apple A17 processor with a built-in GPU that supports hardware ray tracing and MetalFX upscaler. The A17's performance is only 7% lower than the performance of Apple's powerful M2 laptop chip. Instead of a key for switching sound modes, Apple has added a universal, customizable Action Button in the style of the Apple Watch Ultra, to which you can assign the function the user needs. Instead of the usual Lightning port, a USB cable with support for data transfer at 10 Gbps is now used for charging. Alternatively, you can use wireless charging.</p>
        <h3>Super Retina XDR screen with Dynamic Island cutout</h3>
        <p>Apple, as always, has seriously improved the camera in the firmware. The main sensor of the camera has a resolution of 48 MP, providing the ability to change focal length, record 48 MP HEIF images, and is also equipped with 5x optical zoom and 3D video recording capability for the Vision Pro augmented reality headset. The Super Retina XDR display remains the excellent OLED screen, retaining the Dynamic Island notch, satellite module and Crash Detection system from the previous version.</p>
